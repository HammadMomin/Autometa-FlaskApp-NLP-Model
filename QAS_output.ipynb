The Stoics identified the path to eudaimonia with a life spent practicing virtue and living in accordance with nature.Alongside Aristotelian ethics, the Stoic tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to virtue ethics.[1] The Stoics are especially known for teaching that virtue is the only good for human beings, and that external things, such as health, wealth, and pleasure, are not good or bad in themselves (adiaphora) but have value as material for virtue to act upon. Many Stoics\\u2014such as Seneca and Epictetus\\u2014emphasized that because virtue is sufficient for happiness, a sage would be emotionally resilient to misfortune. The Stoics also held that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, and they believed people should aim to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accordance with nature. Because of this, the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved.[2] To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they believed everything was rooted in nature.\"\n",
